		<h1>Welcome To The Unit Circle!</h1>
		<p class="paragraph-text">You may have heard about this little concept in your trigonometry class called the unit circle, but what is it, and why is everyone so interested in it?</p>
		<p class="paragraph-text">In short, the unit circle describes a circle with a radius of <Math>1</Math> and is used to illustrate the relationships between the various trigonometric functions, mainly <Math>sin()</Math> and <Math>cos()</Math>. After learning about the unit circle, you will be able to evaluate these functions at certain significant degree measures around a circle. The unit circle is also a great way to familiarize yourself with thinking in both degrees <i>and</i> radians, all the way from <Math>0</Math> to <Math>2&pi;</Math>.</p>
		<p class="paragraph-text">Before we get into the fun mathematics, it will be important to lay out some basic concepts and definitions:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><span class="definition">Coterminal Angles</span><span class="paragraph-mono">:</span> Two angles that have the same initial point and end point but not necessarily the same angle measure. Examples of this are <Math>30&deg; (&pi;/6)</Math> and <Math>390&deg; (13&pi;/6)</Math>. This also works with negative angles like <Math>240&deg;</Math> and <Math>-120</Math>. Another helpful way to think of this is the <Math>mod 360&deg; (2&pi;)</Math> of an angle.</li>
		  <li><span class="definition">Trigonometric Functions</span><span class="paragraph-mono">:</span> Any of the leg angles on a triangle has a set of sides which are the Opposite Leg, Adjacent Leg, and the Hypotenuse. These are used in turn with several trigonometric functions to define relationships and measures of the triangle. The value of <Math>sin(&theta;)</Math> (where <Math>&theta;</Math> represents any angle measure) is the result of the expression <Math>O / H</Math> where <Math>O</Math> represents the opposite leg, and <Math>H</Math> represents hypotenuse. The other leg is the adjacent leg, represented by an <Math>A</Math>. This is seen in the definition of <Math>cos(&theta;)</Math>, which is <Math>A / H</Math>. The last of the main three functions is <Math>tan(&theta;) = O / A</Math>. These do not appear in this article, but <Math>sin()</Math>, <Math>cos()</Math>, and <Math>tan()</Math> each have respective functions <Math>csc()</Math>, <Math>sec()</Math>, and <Math>cot()</Math>, which are their reciprocals.</li>
